# personal-website
This is my personal website's source code!
Note:
This repository also contains the inspiration and idea for the website and that repository can be found here:https://github.com/QwertyBoss-Code/minimal-portfolio-html-template. Remember that the given link is a fork of the actual project. 
This website was created as a hobby and just wanted to experiment with my website ideas! I hope you find this repository useful as you can re-use, basically ctrl+v the code for your own needs!

About the code itself
The CSS footer in the website code is from CodePen and I have not made it. It is there so that I can use it later and so can you! I want to make the website animated and clean, and most importantly, minimalist. 

The annotations are not great, so I will add more later and will make a release just for the annotations so that the code will be easier to read and undserstand.

The code is also formatted very well by using the Visual Studio Code's formatting tool.

More updates will be coming soon!
