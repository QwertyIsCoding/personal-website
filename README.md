>About
This poject currently has my "old" website's code as well as it can be useful while you are building your own website. The code might be a little messy but this project is basically archived. It isn't yet but you might ass well think it is temporarily because I am not going to update this anytime soon... You can expect updates after about an year or so from 2022. If you would like to contribute to this project or join my organisation(@QwertyPanda), do feel free to email me. Spam is not wanted. Thanks.
