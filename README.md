This is my personal website's source code!
Note:
This repository also contains the inspiration and idea for the website and that repository can be found here:https://github.com/QwertyBoss-Code/minimal-portfolio-html-template. Remember that the given link is a fork of the actual project. 
This website was created as a hobby and just wanted to experiment with my website ideas! I hope you find this repository useful as you can re-use, basically ctrl+v the code for your own needs!
