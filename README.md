# personal-website
This is my personal website's source code!
Note:
This repository also contains the inspiration and idea for the website and that repository can be found here:https://github.com/QwertyBoss-Code/minimal-portfolio-html-template. Remember that the given link is a fork of the actual project. 
This website was created as a hobby and just wanted to experiment with my website ideas! I hope you find this repository useful as you can re-use, basically ctrl+v the code for your own needs!

About the code itself
The CSS footer in the website code is from CodePen and I have not made it. It is there so that I can use it later and so can you! I want to make the website animated and clean, and most importantly, minimalist. 

The annotations are not great, so I will add more later and will make a release just for the annotations so that the code will be easier to read and undserstand.

The code is also formatted very well by using the Visual Studio Code's formatting tool.

More updates will be coming soon!

If you would want to contribute to this project, follow the followinf steps:
Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.
Clone the repository

clone this repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

git clone "url you just copied"

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

copy URL to clipboard

For example:

git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/first-contributions.git

where this-is-you is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.
Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

cd first-contributions

Now create a branch using the git checkout command:

git checkout -b your-new-branch-name

For example:

git checkout -b add-alonzo-church

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word add in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)
Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open Contributors.md file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

git status

If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:

git add Contributors.md

Now commit those changes using the git commit command:

git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"

replacing <your-name> with your name.
Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command git push:

git push origin <add-your-branch-name>

replacing <add-your-branch-name> with the name of the branch you created earlier.
Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.

create a pull request

Now submit the pull request.

submit pull request

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
Where to go from here?

Congrats! You just completed the standard fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!
